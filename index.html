    <h1>Luffy's Friends</h1>
    <p>
        Luffy has awesome friends, they all have different personalities of their own.
        I like the character Roronoa Zoro, he's the right hand and the first member of
        the StrawHat's. Read in more details about his friends. </p>

    <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Roronoa_Zoro">Zoro</a></h3>
    <p>
        He's the swordsman of the group and doesn't have sense of direction. Zoro usually maintains a
        very stern, serious , and distanced
        personality,but often loses his temper in a goofy and exaggerated comical style.
    </p>

    <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Usopp">Usopp</a></h3>
    <p>
        Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and became "God" Usopp due to some
        circumstances. Usopp has a pessimistic, cowardly personality and you can say he's
        the best buddy of Luffy while having fun.

    </p>

    <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Sanji">Sanji Vinsmoke</a></h3>
    <p>
        Sanji is a noticeable character, he is kind, calm, cool, and collected manner in which he
        carries himself. He's the cook, without him Luffy may die due to starvation. He's a womanizer,
        romantic and everyody loves his chivalry towards women.
    </p>

    <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Nami">Nami</a></h3>
    <p>
        Nami, if she is missing, they would have been lost somewhere in the end of the world. She is the best
        navigator as per Luffy. She can trade anything for money even her friends.
    </p>

    <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Tony_Tony_Chopper">Tony Tony Chopper</a></h3>

        the only person
        in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs,
        a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government. </p>

        Franky is an exhibitionist and a self proclaimed pervert and has a very slow slow fashion, loves to e only in an
        underwear.
        he's the robo-cup and Luffy loves all the technological cool stuff of his.
    </p>

    <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Brook">Brook</a></h3>

        He's pretty much the ghost who devoured the Revive-Revive fruit accidentally after he was dead. He's a total
        skeleton, whenever
        introduces himself to the ladies always asks to see their panties.
